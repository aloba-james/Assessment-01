Python Coding Task — Build a Simple Library API
You have 50 minutes to build a simple Library API where users can borrow books.
Please use a Python backend framework — such as Flask, FastAPI, or Django.
(You must use Python — not Node.js or another language.)
1. Add a Book
Endpoint: POST /books
 Input (JSON):
{ "title": "Book Title", "author": "Book Author" }

Output: The created book object with an auto-generated id.
2. Register a User
Endpoint: POST /users
Input (JSON):
{ "name": "Alice" }

Output: The created user object with an auto-generated id.
3. Borrow a Book
Endpoint: POST /borrow
Input (JSON):
{ "userId": 1, "bookId": 2 }

Rules:
A book can only be borrowed if it’s not already borrowed.
 Output: A confirmation message like:
 {"message": "Book borrowed successfully"}


4. List Borrowed Books by User
Endpoint: GET /users/:id/borrowed
Output: A list of all books borrowed by that user.
What We’re Looking For
Clear, correct implementation of the above rules.


Code that runs without errors.


Simple, readable structure.


Ability to explain your decisions.


Notes
Use in-memory storage (e.g., Python lists or dictionaries).


No database setup required.


If you finish early, you can add extras like:


Returning a book


Input validation and error messages


Preventing invalid user/book IDs
